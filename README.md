# Mini project 3 - 2/20/26
## Live link: shopfantasy.vercel.app
### This project was made by Brandon Foshe

#### This project uses Vite and React to create a fantasy-style online shopping website
#### The conversion rate is 100 copper -> 1 silver, and 100 silver -> 1 gold
#### The user has the ability to - 
* Add items to their cart (right box) from the shop (left box)
* Remove some (not always 1) of a product from their cart
* Remove all of one item from their cart
* View the price of each product in the shop
* View the total of each item in their cart
* View the total cost of their cart
* And Checkout, erasing all the items in the cart
#### Items in the cart will always be sorted to the order they appear in the shop, no matter what order you add them in
#### Some items have special variants (like large/small) or different quantity buttons (add 1 or add 10) for user convenience
#### The items in the shop showcase unique features of the website
#### There are sales on Herbs, Rubies, Emeralds, and Gem Powder
